## Jennifer Hightower
In 2023 I became interested in learning more in Machine Learning and AI.  As a Data Analyst I was curious about learning more about the new technologies in these fields, so I took UTA's post graduate certificate in Machine Learning in AI which I finished in November 2023, and fell in love with AI.  I wanted to continue to pursue my interest in Machine Learning and AI, and wanted to build a portfolio of some of my projects below.

Feel free to take a look!

### Exploratory Data Analysis



### Supervised Learning

#### 1. Decission Trees: https://github.com/jenniferhightowergit/Portfolio/blob/main/TravelPAckagePurchasePredictionJenniferHightower.ipynb
The "Visit with us" travel company dataset is used to analyze the customers' information and build a model to predict the potential customer who is going to purchase the newly introduced package.
** Skills & Tools Covered
- EDA
- Data Preprocessing
- Customer Profiling
- Bagging Classifiers - Bagging and Random Forest
- Boosting Classifier - AdaBoost
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- Stacking Classifier
- Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV
- and Business Recommendations



#### 2. Logistic Regression with Neural Networking:

To understand why customers leave the bank and possibly make recommendations on how to keep current customers.
** Skills & Tools Covered
- EDA
- Data Preprocessing
- Customer Profiling
- Logistic Regression
- K-Fold validation to estimate the model's performance
- Deep learning framework using Keras API, and Neural Network Architecture using multiple hidden layers
- Using SMOTE to improve the model
- Using Ridge techniques to improve model
- Using Adam, relu and different activation functions like tanh and sigmoid to improve the accuracy of the model
