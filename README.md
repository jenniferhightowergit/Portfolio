In 2023 I became interested in learning more in Machine Learning and AI.  As a Data Analyst I was curious about learning more about the new technologies in these fields, so I took UTA's post graduate certificate in Machine Learning in AI which I finished in November 2023, and fell in love with AI.  I wanted to continue to pursue my interest in Machine Learning and AI, and wanted to build a portfolio of some of my projects below.

Feel free to take a look!
